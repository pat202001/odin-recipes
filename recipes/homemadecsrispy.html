     <br>
     <h1> Ingredients</h1> <br>
     <ul>
        <li> 2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li> <br>
        <li> ½ medium onion, finely chopped</li> <br>
        <li> ¼ cup all-purpose flour</li><br>
        <li> 1 egg</li> <br>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed </li> <br>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste </li> <br>
    </ul>
     <h1> Steps</h1>
     <ol>
        <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li> Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. </li>
        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.  </li>  <br>
        <li> Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
             When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer.
              Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes. </li> <br>
        <li> Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side.
             It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, 
             it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li> <br>
        <li> Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li> br 
        <li> Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
     </ol>
